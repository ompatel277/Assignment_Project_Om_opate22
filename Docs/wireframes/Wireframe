Wireframes for Traject:
I am still figuring out the wireframe situation as I continue to develop the project. But for the basic of the project I do wnt a clean and simple login/sign-up page, a page where the user can customize it to their personal needs and experiences.
Have an explore page where the user can explore certain pathways, careers, or get a mixture of both and map out a outline of was courses and clubs to join to get the fullest exposure.
I also want a page of a map where the users can compare and contrast or mix certain classes and clubs and customize it to their liking.
