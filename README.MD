# Assignment_Project_Om_opate22
PathFinder will help current, former, or even upcoming students in college explore and get detailed maps of specifc career related roles. This app will allow students to filter to a specific career roles and find classes, and clubs that are associated at their school. This app will help students become more prepared for certain roles by exploring classes and clubs related to real-world interests.  



Why these models/fields?
I chose these models because I can get an idea of what the app would look like when the user first sign-up and logs in. I think it will help me add or eliminate possible features.

Your relationship choices (ForeignKey, on_delete rationale),
ForeignKey, unique, and primary key. I am still playing around with these optoins not set and stone yet but will figure out more as I continue the project

Any constraints (unique, ordering),
I did make a unique and ordering but I got that from chatGPT and I do not know what it does fully. I was just experimenting on how things would look. But once again I will figure it out with trial and error throughout the project

How you seeded test data.
I manually added the data from the admin dashboard. I do want to try to do the dummydata once I have everything connected. 

For A4 I added 2 different urls in views. Both display a list of users# Assignment_Project_Om_opate22
